                    <h2>Prehistoric Fashion</h2>
                    <p>In prehistoric times, people did not think about style the way we do today. Clothes were mainly for protection — from cold, animals, and injuries. Men and women wore animal skins, usually from deer or bears. These were cut and wrapped around the body, tied with leather straps or vines. Clothing was often rough and simple, but some groups began decorating them with shells, feathers, bones, or animal teeth to show group identity, hunting success, or importance in the tribe. Footwear was basic: often leather coverings tied around the feet.</p>

                    <h2>Ancient Greek Fashion</h2>
                    <p>In Ancient Greece, fashion became more structured and graceful. Both men and women wore long pieces of cloth, not sewn into modern clothes but wrapped and pinned. The most common item was the chiton — a tunic made from linen or wool. Richer people wore light, fine fabrics and sometimes used dyes for soft colors like purple or yellow. Over the chiton, people wore an himation (a large cloak). Women wore longer chitons and decorated themselves with jewellery, headbands, and braided hairstyles. Fashion was a way to show elegance and citizenship, especially in cities like Athens.</p>

                    <h2>Gallo-Roman Fashion</h2>
                    <p>When the Romans came to Gaul (modern-day France), local people started wearing Roman-style clothes. Men wore a tunic (short for daily life, longer for special events) and sometimes a toga, which was a long, curved piece of cloth worn by citizens. Women wore the stola, a long dress often belted at the waist, and a palla, a type of shawl. Clothes were often made of wool or linen, and the wealthy used silk from Asia. Colors and patterns showed status. Both men and women used fibulae (brooches) to hold clothing, and sandals were the typical shoes.</p>

                    <h2>Medieval Fashion</h2>
                    <p>During the Middle Ages, fashion became more diverse and symbolic. Social class played a big role in how people dressed. Peasants wore simple wool tunics and cloaks, often in brown or grey. In contrast, nobles and royalty wore brightly colored clothes made of velvet, silk, and fur. Rich women wore long gowns with tight bodices, wide sleeves, and sometimes head coverings like veils or elaborate hats. Men wore tunics with belts, hose (tight trousers), and surcoats (long outer garments). Clothes were often decorated with embroidery and even small jewels. Fashion showed wealth, power, and religion.</p>

                    <h2>Renaissance Fashion</h2>
                    <p>The Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) was a time of art, discovery — and luxury fashion. Clothes were no longer just practical: they became a form of personal expression and status. Royalty and nobles wore clothes in rich fabrics like satin, brocade, and damask. Women wore corsets to shape the body, large hooped skirts, and dresses with layers, ribbons, and lace. Their sleeves were often huge and puffed. Men wore doublets (fitted jackets), ruffed collars, tights, and feathered hats. Each region had its own styles, but Italy and France were the trendsetters. Clothes were tailor-made, expensive, and carefully planned.</p>

                    <h2>French Revolution Fashion</h2>
                    <p>The French Revolution brought big changes to society and to fashion. Before the revolution, rich people wore expensive clothes with silk, lace, wigs, and makeup. Their outfits showed their power and money. But after 1789, fashion became simpler. People wanted to look more natural and equal. Women started to wear light dresses inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. Men wore long trousers instead of short pants and stopped wearing wigs. Fashion became a way to show your political ideas. Wearing simple clothes meant you supported the revolution. It was the beginning of a new style: more modern and less luxurious.</p>

                    <h2>19th Century Fashion</h2>
                    <p>Fashion changed a lot during the 19th century. At the start, women wore Empire-style dresses with high waists. Later, they wore huge skirts with crinolines and tight corsets to shape their bodies. Clothes were beautiful but very uncomfortable. Men dressed in suits with vests, ties, and top hats. The Industrial Revolution helped people buy cheaper, ready-made clothes. Fashion magazines and department stores appeared, so more people could follow trends. Clothing showed your social class and your wealth. Even though clothes became easier to get, elegant style was still very important for rich families.</p>

                    <p>La Belle Époque was a time of elegance, art, and luxury in fashion. Women wore long, decorative dresses with tight corsets to create an "S-shape" body. They also wore large hats with feathers and flowers. Men looked stylish in dark suits, hats, and gloves. Paris was the center of fashion, and designers like Paul Poiret started to create more modern clothes. Fashion was inspired by art movements like Art Nouveau. The rich used clothes to show off their money and style. However, working-class people dressed much more simply. Beauty and elegance were everywhere, but comfort was not a priority.</p>

                    <p>The two World Wars had a strong effect on fashion. During World War I, women worked in factories and needed comfortable clothes. Skirts became shorter, and corsets disappeared. Men were in uniform, and military style became part of everyday fashion. In the 1920s, after WWI, women wore short dresses and cut their hair short – this was the flapper look. During World War II, many materials like silk or leather were limited. Clothes had to be simple and practical. Women often wore trousers for work. Fashion became more about function than beauty. After WWII, Christian Dior created the “New Look” with long skirts and a return to elegance.</p>

Sportswear was very popular, with brands like Nike and Adidas everywhere. Denim was also a big trend — jeans, jackets, and skirts were all in style. Pop stars like Madonna and Michael Jackson inspired many young people. Big hairstyles and flashy accessories were a must. In the 1990s, fashion became more relaxed and simple. The grunge look appeared, with flannel shirts, baggy jeans, and band T-shirts. Teenagers often followed trends from TV shows and music videos.</p>

Virtual fashion will be important, especially in digital worlds like the metaverse. Clothes might be both real and digital! Sustainability will be a big priority, with clothes made from recycled or natural materials. Robots might help people choose or create their style.
